         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That therefore we may come as fit and worthy gueſts, wee muſt before hand prepare our ſelues: For if the

               </gap>neſt praiers, that he would purge the chamber of our heart, in which Chriſt will eate his Paſſeouer with vs.</p>
            <p>Now that we might fitly prepare, and wholſomely participate of the Table of the Lord, the Apoſtle hath ſet downe two things: firſt what we muſt doe before wee come there; namely examine, &amp;c. 2. What wee muſt doe when we are there: namely eate of that bread, and drinke of that cup.</p>
            <p>If it be askt who muſt examine, or
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14621:127"/> who muſt be examined, the Apoſtle reſolues a man;<note place="margin">Who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, who exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> or as <hi>Beza, Quiſque:</hi> Euery man, the examiner, his owne ſoule and conſcience, his owne ſelfe; for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle: Let a man examine himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The touch-ſtone is for the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, this triall is for our ſelues. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man heere is of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> to examine whether his owne heart bee holie or hollow, his loue falſe, or vnfained, his wares, his workes good, or adulterated, his coine baſe or currant: which that a man be able to doe, it is neceſſary as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> requires, that he be ready to render a reaſon of the faith and hope that is in him: and how can he be ready to render a reaſon of his faith, &amp;c. when he knowes not a reaſon of his faith? how is it poſſible that a man ſhould examine himſelfe, when he knowes not vpon what interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he ſhould examine himſelfe? The heart of man is deceitfull aboue all things, how ſhall he be able to finde out the corruptions thereof, that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:14621:127"/> is not taught out of the word, to know when his heart is vpright, and when it is corrupt? How ſhall hee bee able to try or examine his faith, that knowes not of what faith hee is? led in blindneſſe, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſuperſtition, and can ſay no more of what he belieues, but that he belieues as the Church belieues.</p>
            <p>Herein the blinde guides of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> haue much abuſed the Church, and ſimple ones of the church: herein the doctrine of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is contrary to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doctrine; for if euery man be to examin himſelf, it is manifeſt that no man that comes to this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt be ſo ignorant, as not to know what is required to be in himſelfe, what hee is to ſearch for in himſelfe? which he can neuer doe, which can ſay no more for his faith, then that he belieues as the Church belieues, not knowing what the Church belieues.</p>
            <p>If a man can examine himſelf and do not, his neglect is haynous, his danger is more great; if we will not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:14621:128"/> ſearch our ſelues, he that hath fierie eyes will ſearch vs: Let no man think to lie hid in the multitude, and ſay; if God haue a liſt, <hi>Omnes punire nocentes quando ad m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> veniet?</hi> to puniſh all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, when will he come to mee? When the King came in the Goſpell to ſee his gueſts, hee eſpied one that had not on a wedding garment, and he bid take that one, and binde him hand and foote, and caſt him into vtter darkenes: there was but one <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> at the Supper with our Sauiour, and the diuell entred into him. This is a duty required, the neglect of it is not without danger, for that beſides it may bring on vs the euerlaſting puniſhments, a thing greatly to bee feared, it makes vs alſo in perill of temporall puniſhments; for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in the wordes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for this cauſe many are weake and ſickely amongſt you, and many ſleepe.</p>
            <p>As euery one of vs therefore would bee carefull to auoide both the temporall and eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:14621:128"/> ſo let vs come to this table prepared, hauing before exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

            <p>Onely let me admoniſh thee, that there be not in thee a ſhow and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent minde comming to this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that thou ſtirre vp thy ſelfe to attend to what thou doeſt, and if thou feele any want in thy ſelfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame to God, &amp; ſay: I know O Lord, that thou requireſt of thy gueſts a conſcience pure from ſinne, good intention, a good deuotion, faith, repentance, &amp;c.

            <p>Now from that which we are to doe before we come to the Lords ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">What wee ſhould doe at the Lords ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> let vs come to that which we are to doe at the Lords table: ſo let <hi>him eate of that bread and drinke of that cup:</hi> when a man hath examined and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, it is not left at his diſcretion whether he will communicate or no, but he muſt firſt examine, and then eate: for whereas the ſacraments are badges by which we Chriſtians are knowne from vnbeleeuers and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters in the vſe of them, wee muſt needes communicate, vnleſſe we will ſhew our ſelues aſhamed of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith.</p>
            <p>This ſacrament is a ſeale to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our faith; therefore as we deſire to haue an aſſurance of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:14621:135"/> ſealed vp vnto vs let vs come vnto this table.

            <p>What though <hi>Augustine</hi> ſay? <hi>Crede &amp; manducaſti,</hi> Beleeue and thou haſt eaten, yet let no man thinke that is ſufficient to beleeue and not to eate: for although there is no holeſome eating without faith, yet at the Lords table we are holpen, furthered and confirmed in our faith by our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſences.</p>
            <p>When we heare it ſaid, <hi>this is my body, &amp;c.</hi> (faith you know is by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,) we are ſtirred vp to lay ſtrong hold on the promiſes of God, when we heare this word, <hi>doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> We are aſſured that this is Chriſts commandement, when we ſee the bread broken, &amp; the wine
